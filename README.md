This rigorously tested fully-typed library just works. It neither defines nor throws any exceptions.

# Install

    composer require sanmai/later

The latest version requires PHP 7.1 or greater.

# Use 

To use this pattern you need a generator function, yielding a single item of type you want to produce lazily. 

For example:

```php
$deepThoughtMaker = function () {
    $deepThought = new DeepThought();
    $deepThought->solveTheQuestion();

    yield $deepThought;
})
```

Now pass it to `later()`, a static wrapper returning a `Deferred` object:

```php
$deferredMaker = later($deepThoughtMaker);
```

And then call `get()` when needed:

```php
$deferredMaker->get()->getAnswer(); // 42
$deferredMaker->get()->getAnswer(); // same 42
```

The generator guarantees it will be executed only once.

# Discussion

The library is completely typed. 

To exploit this capability it is recommended to add a convenience method, returning the object itself:

```php
class DeepThought
{
    public function solveTheQuestion(): void
    {
        // Takes 7Â½ million years to compute
    }

    public function getAnswer(): int
    {
        return 42;
    }

    /**
     * Convenience method. Can be called just get(), getThis(), or anything you'd like.
     */
    public function getSupercomputer(): self
    {
        return $this;
    }
}
```

Perfomance-wise, `get()` is probably the best call.

Then, in a consumer, declare a variable holding this object as a union `Type|Deferred<Type>`.

In our example it will be `DeepThought|Deferred<DeepThought>`: 

```php
final class HyperIntelligentMice
{
    /** @var DeepThought|Deferred<DeepThought> */
    private $supercomputer;

    public function __construct(DeepThought $deepThought)
    {
        $this->supercomputer = later(static function () use ($deepThought): iterable {
            $deepThought->solveTheQuestion();

            yield $deepThought;
        });
    }

    public function getAnswer(): int
    {
        return $this->supercomputer->getSupercomputer()->getAnswer();
    }
}
```

In this case, a static analyzer will understand what is called, and what is returned.
